- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hayley_S
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and turning my interest into a successful career. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java in my third year studying at the Open University. I have briefly played around with Python and HTML in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something suitable for a total beginner! I want to start putting together a portfolio ready for when I gain my degree.
